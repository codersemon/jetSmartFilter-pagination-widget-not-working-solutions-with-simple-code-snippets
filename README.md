# jetSmartFilter plugin pagination issues fixing by use custom php code snippets

## Introduction
Due to some limitation of jetsmart filter plugins, I was using another filter plugin which is "Filter Everything Pro". Limitation was that for text based meta field value filter, we have to use predefined text for filtering, but in my project I was taking text filed input for the product meta, which is not handled by jet smart filter plugin. Then I found "Filter Everything Pro" plugin and it's worked perfectly. 

But when I was using pagination module in custom shop page for woocommerce from jet smart filter plugin, it was unable to work perfectly. I have explained in the video more details regarding the problem and the solution.
